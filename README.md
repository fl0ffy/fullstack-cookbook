### Future Project Ideas

1. **Animal trading cards (Udacity)**
  <br>
  Create a simple, interactive, text-based adventure game in Python, using modules, loops, conditionals, and functions. This project will demonstrate the ability to write correct Python syntax, practice with fundamental programming logic, refactor code using functions, and ultimately write a complete Python script that results in a working, playable game.<br>

2. **Shopping cart (Udacity)**
  <br>
  In this project, learners will use their JavaScript development skills to build the core functionality of an eCommerce shopping cart for Kiranaâ€™s fruit market. They will create a collection of products and then write the JavaScript code to add, remove, and change the quantity of a product in a shopping cart. They will also write the JavaScript code for the checkout functions: making a purchase and returning change.
  <br><br>

3. **Artists Gallery (Personal idea)**
  <br>
  Think facebook but for Artist's portfolio. Include components
  <br>
  -- Industry-approved Artist's resume<br>
  -- Professional Artist Bio<br>
  -- Industry approved artist website components<br>
  -- links to social media
  <br><br>
